A lightweight web app that retrieves real-time London bus arrival data using the TfL API. Users input a five-digit stop code to view live arrival times, focusing on clear data handling and responsive UI behaviour.
- _note: there are temporary restrictions on TFL systems, data and API access. Some accessible 5-digit codes can be [found here](https://github.com/aaronAlien/Live-Bus-TFL/blob/main/testStops.txt)_.
